# Python Basics - Sigma Labs Pre-Course

A collection of Python exercises completed as part of the Sigma Labs pre-course program.

## Project Overview

This repository contains two Python scripts demonstrating fundamental programming concepts:

1. **maxmin.py** - Find the maximum and minimum values in a list
2. **age.py** - Calculate a person's age from their date of birth

## Scripts

### maxmin.py

Prompts the user to enter a list of integers and returns the highest and lowest numbers without using Python's built-in `max()` or `min()` functions.

**Usage:**
```bash
python maxmin.py
```

**Example:**
```
Enter a list of integers separated by commas: 2, 4, 1, 0, 2, -1
Lowest: -1, Highest: 4
```

### age.py

Asks the user for their date of birth in YYYY-MM-DD format and calculates their current age.

**Usage:**
```bash
python age.py
```

**Example:**
```
Enter your date of birth (YYYY-MM-DD): 1995-06-15
You are 29 years old.
```
